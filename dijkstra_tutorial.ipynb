    "# Intro to Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a tutorial describing how Djikstra's shortest path algorithm works, as well as providing a Python implementation with extensive comments. The code was re-written based on Alex Woods's implementation [here](https://alexhwoods.com/dijkstra/). I also recommend the visualizations [here](https://brilliant.org/wiki/dijkstras-short-path-finder/) for seeing how the algorithm proceeds in a step-by-step fashion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following code implements Dijkstra's route-finding algorithm to find the shortest paths through a directed graph. The code has three components:\n",
    "1. A `Graph` class that generates the data structure. This class contains _vertices_ (also called _nodes_) that represent intersection points, and _edges_, which correspond to paths between vertices. These edges have _weights_, or numeric values representing the distance between vertices along that edge.\n",
    "2. A `find_paths` function which measures the distances between vertices, finding the shortest possible paths.\n",
    "3. A `shortest_path` function which takes two vertex IDs as inputs and returns the shortest path"

    "    4d. for each neighbor vertex that isn't in `already_visited`, check to see if traveling to the neighbor through `v` is shorter than the currently known shortest path (stored in `distances`). If it is, replace `distances[neighbor]` with `distances[v] + graph.weights[v, neighbor]`.  \n",
